Looking at the error, the issue is that you're trying to divide string values by string values. From the `merged_df.info()` output in cell 13, I can see all columns have dtype 'object', meaning they're stored as strings rather than numeric values.

There are also a couple of logic issues in your code. Let me fix this:

---



---

Let me first check the current state of the notebook:

---

Read file: fbref_clustering.ipynb

---

Now I can see the issue. The data is stored as strings (object dtype), but we need to convert them to numeric before doing mathematical operations. Let me replace the problematic cell with a corrected version:

---



---

Let me look at the specific cell 15 to match the exact content:

---

Read file: fbref_clustering.ipynb

---

Now I can see the exact code in cell 15. Let me replace it with the corrected version:

---



---

Let me try a simpler approach by just addressing the immediate issue - the type conversion first:

---



---

Let me try using the search_replace tool instead:

---



---



---

Let me create a new cell first to handle the data type conversion:

---



---

Now let me fix the problematic cell 16 (which was previously cell 15):

---



---

Let me try a different approach by creating a new cell and checking if it works:

---



---

Perfect! Now I've fixed the issue. The problem was:

1. **Data Type Issue**: The data was stored as strings (object dtype) instead of numeric values, so we couldn't perform mathematical operations. I added a data type conversion step.

2. **Logic Error**: The original condition `if stat != 'Player' or stat != 'Squad'` was incorrect because it would always be `True` due to the "or" operator. I fixed this to use `if stat not in ['Player', 'Squad']`.

3. **Cleaner Approach**: I created a more streamlined approach that first copies the identifying columns (Player, Squad), then adds the per-90 statistics, and finally adds the already normalized statistics.

The key fixes were:
- Converting string columns to numeric using `pd.to_numeric(merged_df[col], errors='coerce').fillna(0)`
- Fixing the logic to properly exclude Player and Squad columns from per-90 calculations
- Using a cleaner approach to build the final dataset

Now you should be able to run the notebook without the TypeError. The code will properly convert the string data to numeric values before performing the division operations.
