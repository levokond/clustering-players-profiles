# clustering-players-profiles

future updates:
1. Pay more attention to the location data (so there would be no clusters specifically focusing on right/left side of the pitch
2. Next time try different clustering methods as well
3. Make all the data conversion code a function
4. get more data for initial training
5. remember what was another point, it was something very important!!
